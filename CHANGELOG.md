# v1.1.0
### Additions
* New UI with better formatting and the selected ore's texture
* Refromatted depth and rarity information: `[y_min, y_max]: rarity%  (shape)`
* Added main page which explains on depth and rarity information
* Add buttons in sfinv and inventory_plus
* New scaling for better readability on smaller screens. Now easily readable in Minetest my phone!
### Fixes
* Fixed bad conditional possibly selecting the wrong ore in depth and rarity info
* Fixed rarity calculation using the size of a cluster (space the ores would be spread in) instead of the number of ores in a cluster.
